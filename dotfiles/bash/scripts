# mdfind to use spotlight from the command line - really really really handy! 
# Finds things in every directory as well, so it's more useful when looking 
# for files that are part of the system.
# 
# mdfind -live updates in real time, which again is incredibly handy.

# When you're editing a particularly long and gnarly command line ^X^E 
# (Ctrl-X Ctrl-E) will pop you into your editor and let you work on it there.

# You can also use other emacs keybindings: 
# ctrl-b, ctrl-f (forward or backward one); 
# ctrl-k (kill from position to end of line); 
# ctrl-y (paste previously killed text); 
# ctrl-p, ctrl-n (up or down in command line history)

# Ctrl-a moves to the start of the line
# Ctrl-e moves to the end of the line
# Ctrl-b move back on character
# Ctrl-f move forward one character
# Esc-b move back one word
# Esc-f move forward one word
# Ctrl-u delete from the cursor to the beginning of the line
# Ctrl-k delete from the cursor to the end of the line


# hdutil
# With hdiutil you can easilly mount a disk image:
# 
# hdiutil mount ~/Desktop/lastest_webkit.dmg
# Dismounting (hacker way):
# 
# hdiutil detach `df | grep WebKit | perl -pe 's@^/dev/([a-zA-Z0-9]+).*@$1@'`
# Dismounting (easy way):
# 
# hdiutil detach /Volumes/<mountpoint>
# or take the easier approach (that churnd suggested below):
# 
# hdiutil detach /Volumes/latest_webkit
